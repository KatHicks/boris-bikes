Boris Bikes
===========

Week 1 Challenge at Makers Academy
----------------------------------

Transport for London come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

Main goal:
----------

**Can you use a test-driven approach to write object-oriented code?**

Issues
------
User Stories; Can you have 2 messages on the same line?

From Feature Tests to Unit Tests; Why Ruby Error, not Rspec error? Perhaps because of the lack of apostrophes around DockingStation, maybe Ruby recognises it as a Ruby object rather than an Rspec test.
