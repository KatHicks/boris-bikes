Boris Bikes
===========

Week 1 Challenge at Makers Academy
----------------------------------

Transport for London come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

Main goal:
----------

**Can you use a test-driven approach to write object-oriented code?**

Issues
------
- User story domain models: can you have two `messages` on the same line (i.e. for the same `object`)?
- What is the difference between a feature test and a unit test?
  - Feature testing is done in IRB - pretending you're a user
  - Unit testing is done with RSpec - testing a specific bit of behaviour
- What is the difference between a Ruby error, not Rspec failure?
  - Ruby error means that there is a syntax issue with your code, whereas a Rspec failure means that code is technically correct but not behaving as you'd expect
